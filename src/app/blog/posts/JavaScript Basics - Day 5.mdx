## Introduction

Welcome to **Day 5** of the JavaScript Basics series ðŸŽ‰.  
Today weâ€™ll learn about **loops and iteration** â€” techniques that allow you to repeat actions until a condition is met.

---

## The `for` Loop

The classic `for` loop repeats a block of code a specific number of times.

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    highlight="3"
    codes={[
  {
    code:
`for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log("Number: " + i);
}

// Output: 1 2 3 4 5`,
    language: "js",
    label: "for-loop.js"
  }
]} />

---

## The `while` Loop

The `while` loop runs as long as its condition is true.

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    highlight="3"
    codes={[
  {
    code:
`let count = 1;

while (count <= 3) {
  console.log("Count is " + count);
  count++;
}`,
    language: "js",
    label: "while-loop.js"
  }
]} />

---

## The `do...while` Loop

The `do...while` loop runs **at least once**, even if the condition is false.

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    highlight="3"
    codes={[
  {
    code:
`let num = 5;

do {
  console.log("Number is " + num);
  num++;
} while (num < 5);`,
    language: "js",
    label: "do-while-loop.js"
  }
]} />

---

## Looping Through Arrays

### Using `for...of`

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    highlight="3"
    codes={[
  {
    code:
`const fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Mango"];

for (let fruit of fruits) {
  console.log(fruit);
}`,
    language: "js",
    label: "for-of.js"
  }
]} />

### Using `forEach`

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    highlight="3"
    codes={[
  {
    code:
`fruits.forEach((fruit, index) => {
  console.log(index + ": " + fruit);
});`,
    language: "js",
    label: "for-each.js"
  }
]} />

## Why This Matters

Loops make your programs **efficient** by automating repetitive tasks.  
Whether iterating through an array of products or processing API data, loops are everywhere in JavaScript.
